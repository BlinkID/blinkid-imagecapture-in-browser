### New features and updates

*   We've expanded the set of possible recognizer states with `**StageValid**`. This state fixes `BlinkIDCombinedRecognizer` timeout issues, and enables better control of the Combined scanning pipeline. It activates when the first side of a document has been successfully scanned and scanning of the second side is required.

#### Camera management updates

* We've enabled camera image flipping
    * Method `flipCamera` has been added to [`VideoRecognizer`](src/MicroblinkSDK/VideoRecognizer.ts).
    * You can now let your users mirror the camera image vertically.
    * By default, the UI component will display a flip icon in the top left corner once the camera is live.
* We've improved camera management on devices with multiple cameras 
    * Method `createVideoRecognizerFromCameraStream` has been extended in [`VideoRecognizer` class](src/MicroblinkSDK/VideoRecognizer.ts).
    * Attribute `[camera-id]` has been added to the UI component so that your users can preselect their desired camera.

### Licensing

* We've enabled creation of trial licenses through our Developer Dashboard
    * You can now generate a trial license key yourself to try BlinkID ImageCapture In-browser SDK in your web app

### Fixes

* We've fixed a problem where the UI component would interfere with navigation strategy in SPA frameworks.
    * Value of the `href` attribute in button elements has been changed to `javascript:void(0)`.

## 5.8.0

* initial release of the BlinkID ImageCapture In-browser SDK
* first version is 5.8.0 due to better connection with other BlinkID products
