# Release notes

**Newly supported identity documents**

* Saudi Arabia - DL (front)
* Saudi Arabia - Resident ID (front)

### Changes to the BlinkId(Combined)Recognizer:

* We've improved data extraction through the MRZ:
    * We now return the document type through `ClassInfo`.
* We've extended the `ClassInfo` structure with helper methods so you can filter documents by country more easily:
    * Use `countryName`, `isoNumericCountryCode`, `isoAlpha2CountryCode` and `isoAlpha3CountryCode` to get the full country names or their representative codes defined by [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes).
* We've added another `ProcessingStatus` called `AwaitingOtherSide`
    * This status is triggered once BlinkID has finished with the first side of a document and expects the other side, too.
* We've added a new recognition mode for recognizing still images of documents that have already been cropped:
    * Set the `scanCroppedDocumentImage` to true when you're feeding BlinkID images of documents that have already been cropped and don't require detection.
    * Keep in mind that this setting won't work on document images that haven't been properly cropped.

### Changes to the UI component:

* Weâ€™ve added new ways you can configure the UI component to better fit the way your app looks and behaves.
    * For a full list of attributes, properties and events you can modify, please see the [API documentation](ui/docs/components/blinkid-imagecapture-in-browser/readme.md).
    * For a full list of CSS variables please see [\_globals.scss file](ui/src/components/shared/styles/_globals.scss).

### Changes to RecognizerRunner class:

* Invoking `RecognizerRunner.processImage` on  multiple still images will no longer implicitly reset the recognizer chain.
    * This means you can now use BlinkIdImageCaptureRecognizer with the flag `captureBothDocumentSides` to scan both sides of a document by giving it two still images.
    * If you still need to reset the recognizers, you can do that  manually by invoking the `RecognizerRunner.resetRecognizers` function.
    * A complete example of how to use BlinkIdImageCaptureRecognizer with the flag `captureBothDocumentSides` with still images has been added [here](examples/combined-file).

### New features and updates

*   We've expanded the set of possible recognizer states with `**StageValid**`. This state fixes `BlinkIDCombinedRecognizer` timeout issues, and enables better control of the Combined scanning pipeline. It activates when the first side of a document has been successfully scanned and scanning of the second side is required.

#### Camera management updates

* We've enabled camera image flipping
    * Method `flipCamera` has been added to [`VideoRecognizer`](src/MicroblinkSDK/VideoRecognizer.ts).
    * You can now let your users mirror the camera image vertically.
    * By default, the UI component will display a flip icon in the top left corner once the camera is live.
* We've improved camera management on devices with multiple cameras 
    * Method `createVideoRecognizerFromCameraStream` has been extended in [`VideoRecognizer` class](src/MicroblinkSDK/VideoRecognizer.ts).
    * Attribute `[camera-id]` has been added to the UI component so that your users can preselect their desired camera.

### Licensing

* We've enabled creation of trial licenses through our Developer Dashboard
    * You can now generate a trial license key yourself to try BlinkID ImageCapture In-browser SDK in your web app

### Fixes

* We've fixed a problem where the UI component would interfere with navigation strategy in SPA frameworks.
    * Value of the `href` attribute in button elements has been changed to `javascript:void(0)`.

## 5.8.0

* initial release of the BlinkID ImageCapture In-browser SDK
* first version is 5.8.0 due to better connection with other BlinkID products
